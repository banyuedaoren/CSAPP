1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,030
okay so this is the last lecture for the

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,349
class and I'm sure that you've got a lot

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,340
of other things going on as well so

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,320
thanks for showing up today this is as I

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,900
said last time these two lectures are

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,490
not part of the course syllabus they're

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,189
not on the final exam they're more

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,050
looking to the future and in particular

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,060
what I want to talk about today is some

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:31,439
kind of studying I did over the past

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,630
year about how the electronics industry

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,950
what we now call the semiconductor

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,469
industry but it might be something

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,870
different in the future as new

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:44,910
technology comes along but what what

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,289
directions it's going to head and what

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,750
we'd be able to assume the kind of

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,449
progress that we've come to know and

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,989
expect over the past several decades

20
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:58,170
so in particular and this is important

21
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,570
for obviously for people involved in ECE

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,120
but also for people involved in computer

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,860
science and software because the fact

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:12,119
that we have this massive collection of

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,939
computers data centers powerful cell

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,400
phones and things obviously the software

27
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,979
people are important to that but the

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,430
reality is it's the hardware base that

29
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,500
makes it possible so it's really an

30
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,350
important thing even for software people

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,799
to have a fairly decent understanding of

32
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,229
how the actual systems work what their

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,439
technology is and what's it going to

34
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,229
look like in the future so in particular

35
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,820
we've been riding enjoying the benefits

36
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,200
of what's commonly referred to as

37
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:49,259
Moore's law and Gordon Moore is he still

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,229
alive and was one of the earlier

39
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,960
pioneers in the semiconductor industry

40
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:57,979
he worked for William Shockley who's one

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,290
of the inventors of the transistor and

42
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:03,659
set up there's a company called Shockley

43
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,530
semiconductor that Shockley set up in

44
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,170
the Bay Area in Palo Alto in the late in

45
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,110
the early nineteen know in the 1950s

46
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,810
somewhere and then he

47
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,600
and a group of them left because

48
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,570
Chalkley was such a jerk and found and

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,870
found a home at an existing company

50
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:28,560
called Fairchild that did things like

51
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:32,010
aviation electronics and set up

52
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,380
Fairchild Semiconductor and so that was

53
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,770
really the start of Silicon Valley from

54
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,709
the silicon perspective actually they're

55
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,900
using germanium at the time but what we

56
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:49,950
think of a Silicon Valley really got its

57
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:52,400
start there so he was the the the head

58
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,620
of the research part of Fairchild

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,459
Semiconductor when he wrote an article

60
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,440
for a what's really just a trade press

61
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,110
magazine electronics magazine we

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,680
wouldn't consider it a very important

63
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,500
publication these days but back then it

64
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,790
had some fairly leading articles and so

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:19,890
he wrote an article and this is in 1965

66
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:23,430
so almost exactly 50 years ago and what

67
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,860
he done was he just sort of evolved what

68
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:30,019
his company was able to do in terms of

69
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,130
of building the very new of

70
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,200
semiconductors and it was the very very

71
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,720
early days of integrated circuits when

72
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,890
you could put multiple transistors on a

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:45,720
single chip and what he recognized was

74
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:49,350
there is sort of a curve of met that on

75
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:55,320
this axis is how much does it cost to

76
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:58,709
per transistor to manufacture a system

77
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,080
and on the right hand side how many

78
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,450
transistors there were on a single chip

79
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,350
and what he observed was through sort of

80
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,760
a sweet spot and if you're to the left

81
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,560
you're basically you're not putting

82
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,130
enough things on the chip and so you

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,989
have too many chips and they cost a lot

84
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,540
to connect them together and you're not

85
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,250
making use of the technology and if you

86
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,349
go too far to the right then you're

87
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,210
trying to squeeze more on that chip than

88
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,540
it was economically feasible at the time

89
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,240
and what he also observe

90
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,880
was and this is 65 remember so he was

91
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,910
basically projecting from three years

92
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,810
worth of data that that curve was

93
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:42,560
dropping that and so the sweet spot was

94
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,720
shifting to telling you what's the

95
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:50,930
optimum number of devices to put on a

96
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:53,840
single chip from like 20 here 250 there

97
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,090
too and then he projected out and said

98
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,640
well gee by 1970 we should be able to

99
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:02,180
get a thousand devices on a chip and

100
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,520
that was sort of just a prediction he

101
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,450
made and then that became known as

102
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,630
Moore's law and that name was not made

103
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,140
up by Moore but by actually a professor

104
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:17,650
at Caltech so what we now know of is

105
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,090
Moore's law was really started with this

106
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,590
prediction and two things are worth

107
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,070
noting one is it's a technology

108
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,200
prediction it's based on what this

109
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,620
company and other companies were able to

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,350
do but the other was an economic one it

111
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,330
was saying if you want to make the best

112
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,690
use of this technology and get the most

113
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,130
sort of electronics for your dollar then

114
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,740
you should be following these principles

115
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:47,180
so and that that combination is actually

116
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:50,240
quite important so I went off and found

117
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,940
a Wikipedia page that lists a bunch of

118
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:58,180
different chips for microprocessors and

119
00:05:52,940 --> 00:06:02,150
other types of processors that has the

120
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,090
both the chip area and how many

121
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,160
transistors who were on that and I

122
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:12,020
mapped it out so it starts the first

123
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:17,420
microprocessor was called the 4004 made

124
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:19,790
by Intel in 1971 and up through here you

125
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,700
see that I sort of partitioned these

126
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,860
into different types of processors so a

127
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,110
desktop processor would be like what

128
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,300
you'd have in a PC and they sort of

129
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,390
drove the industry for this middle part

130
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,950
of the time embedded systems are chips

131
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,810
that aren't designed to be computers

132
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,970
that you're using as computers but

133
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,580
they're inside of something for example

134
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:44,199
the earliest micro problem

135
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:49,210
the four thousand four was created by

136
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:51,969
Intel to to run a calculate cop

137
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,069
calculator built by a Japanese company

138
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:56,830
they came to Intel and said could you

139
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:59,169
make us some electronics to implement

140
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,330
this and somebody within Intel I had the

141
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,250
inspiration to say well if we just

142
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,020
implement this as a microprocessor then

143
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,360
we can write the code to implement a

144
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,270
desktop calculator and it's what they

145
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,889
call 4-bit microprocessor so you're used

146
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:16,930
to 32 mentioned four so the word size is

147
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,460
four and how do you do that it's

148
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,759
actually you have to think about how you

149
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:24,699
even do that but that's what it was a

150
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,949
4-bit microprocessor so anyways embedded

151
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:30,719
systems sort of some of these were

152
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:34,240
really a pre PC era and then these

153
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:37,960
diamonds are ones that sort of drove the

154
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,289
PC era and then the yellow are more

155
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,449
recent graphic processor unit which are

156
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:46,270
some of the biggest fastest chips out

157
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:48,460
there the x's are ones that are really

158
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,580
server class machines for example the

159
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:56,680
shark machines and are designed to be

160
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:59,050
inside of a big computer room and down

161
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,110
here for example ones are actually for

162
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,539
cell phones but this is just this is not

163
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,740
a scientific sample it's just a one

164
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:09,219
through which I could find the

165
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:13,389
appropriate data oh and you might ask

166
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:17,409
why did you start in 1971 if this paper

167
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:19,650
came out in 65 well back in 65 the

168
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:22,360
technology is what they called bipolar

169
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:27,339
technology which is not a mental

170
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,029
condition here and the it's very

171
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:31,930
different

172
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:34,120
so the first microprocessor and all the

173
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,390
successor ones are done in a technology

174
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,500
called MOS which stands for metal oxide

175
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:44,949
semiconductor which is in a very useful

176
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,320
name but basically chips since the early

177
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:48,970
seventies have dominantly been using

178
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,839
this technology and the current one is

179
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,399
called CMOS

180
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,490
so anyways the interesting thing you'll

181
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,620
see here is on this log scale you'll see

182
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,390
that this doubling every two years has

183
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:05,000
almost exactly matched what's happened

184
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:11,360
so the gray line is if I just

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,070
extrapolated from from 50 transistors in

186
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,560
1965 and predicted they would double

187
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,220
every two years you get the gray line

188
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,860
and the black line is what I get running

189
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,690
a regression on this data and you'll see

190
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,060
that their scopes are exactly the same

191
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,130
and what that means is the doubling

192
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,950
every two years is absolutely true and

193
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:34,110
the black line what it says is well

194
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,750
actually they in the early days they got

195
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:41,010
ahead of the curve somewhat so that the

196
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:45,270
first microprocessor for example 4004

197
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:49,190
had around well actually I have the

198
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:52,589
numbers actually add 1700 transistors so

199
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:57,029
not too far off of what more addicted

200
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:59,910
for 1970 so anyways that's the point

201
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,890
it's an amazing thing this is held and

202
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,270
you might ask why was like Gordon Moore

203
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:08,640
the the best forecaster of the future

204
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,700
ever to be able to nail this number so

205
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,709
precisely and also why do you call it a

206
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,900
law so there's two things going there's

207
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:18,660
a few things going on here first of all

208
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,820
this is not a law it's not a law of

209
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,810
nature it's not a law of our country

210
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:29,970
it's not a law of of anything it's just

211
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:32,730
a statement that he made but also it's

212
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,829
become a self-fulfilling aw meaning that

213
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,750
because Gordon Moore who is a very

214
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,120
prominent person at the time said this

215
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,730
and said his company in that direction

216
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:48,060
and he then went on to found in tell by

217
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:51,480
the way he and and all of his colleagues

218
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,610
and his sort of burgeoning business have

219
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,670
just been dedicated to the task of

220
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,070
making this a law so it was a prediction

221
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,260
but not in a sort of objective sense it

222
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:05,980
was a prediction by somebody who then

223
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,810
motivated other people to fulfill it so

224
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,390
anyways it's pretty interesting that

225
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,850
just collect and if you can collect all

226
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:16,390
kinds of data and you'll find this this

227
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:18,220
doubling pretty much holds by the way in

228
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,830
general you should whenever you're

229
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,149
looking at a semi-log pot if you have a

230
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:27,010
straight line that's a sign of

231
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:29,200
exponential growth so what does it

232
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:32,920
really mean then it's hard for you to

233
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,540
appreciate how much different the world

234
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,560
of computing is today than it was even

235
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:43,570
20 30 40 years ago so for example in

236
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,040
1976 if you had a lot of money in other

237
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,490
words your Los Alamos National

238
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,550
Laboratory and you really wanted a big

239
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:55,740
computer you could buy it by basically

240
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:58,959
getting a hand-built machine from a

241
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,240
company called Cray headed by Seymour

242
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,630
Cray who is one of the legendary people

243
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,370
in the world of computing at the time

244
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:10,779
but this machine is you see all the

245
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:15,490
numbers for it are way off what even

246
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:18,040
I've got on my phone and what you have

247
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,970
on your phone to write in terms of

248
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:25,600
performance in terms of density this

249
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:30,610
thing weighed 5,000 kilograms and used

250
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,320
115 kilowatts where is now we have these

251
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,240
ones that are powered by batteries and

252
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,180
fit near pockets and the other is

253
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,620
numbers that the whole life of the crane

254
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,040
this was considered an incredibly

255
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:44,740
successful supercomputer the first real

256
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,709
supercomputer in the whole lifetime they

257
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:51,399
manufactured 80 of them and as you know

258
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:54,130
phones sell in the millions so it's

259
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:58,390
really very very different world we live

260
00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:02,829
in because of of the progress of

261
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:07,600
integration and so again to put yourself

262
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:12,370
back back in 65 what I can like I'll

263
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,840
date myself I was a young person at that

264
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,150
time

265
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,420
and for me the coolest thing to get was

266
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:23,830
a portable transistor radio like this

267
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:28,660
one that would play AM stations okay now

268
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:31,180
today what young teenagers crave for is

269
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:37,030
the sort of waitest consumer product of

270
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:39,250
a high-end funk so part of it is if you

271
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,920
look at this they even advertise this

272
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:48,280
transistor radio had nine transistors on

273
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:55,720
it whereas the chip inside of a this is

274
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:58,270
last year's the iPhone six had up has if

275
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,560
you still have one a chip with two

276
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:04,270
billion transistors on it and that's the

277
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,430
main chip there's about eleven chips in

278
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:10,240
an iPhone in a phone by the way that's

279
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:13,090
the main processor chip so that's really

280
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,700
the the fundamental difference of why

281
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:19,110
what you've got today is so different

282
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,110
than what you could get in 65

283
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:26,630
so it's hard to even think about two

284
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,730
billion transistors and what that really

285
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,620
means so here's an analogy imagine a

286
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,380
transistor where the size of a grain of

287
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,810
sand they're actually a lot smaller than

288
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,340
that but just that's about the smallest

289
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,530
thing you can think of sort of picking

290
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,710
up and feeling then if you look at

291
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,810
here's this original four thousand four

292
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,800
had 2,300 transistors I didn't have my

293
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,100
numbers quite right

294
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,620
so that's if you think in sand grains

295
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:55,310
it's um actually I calculated this out

296
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:59,570
it's 170th of a teaspoon so just a very

297
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:03,170
very small pinch of sand is about 2,300

298
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:06,110
grains of sand and nowadays if you think

299
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:09,260
of two billion transistors in in terms

300
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:13,310
of sand that's about 200 pounds of sand

301
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:15,560
so if you go to Home Depot and you buy a

302
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:18,860
bag of sand for your children's for

303
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:22,250
somebody's a sandbox or whatever it's

304
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:28,820
about 50 pounds so about four four bags

305
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:31,940
of sand is 2 billion two billion grains

306
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:36,770
so that sort of where we are today we're

307
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:39,280
at sort of a it's the same as if you

308
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:45,890
filled up big paint bucket three of them

309
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:48,400
sort of that level we're at so just to

310
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:51,260
give you a sense where we are and so

311
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,740
what I claim is and this isn't just my

312
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:58,280
claim it's sort of self-evident that

313
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,500
there's a sort of virtuous cycle that

314
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,840
driven that drives the technology and

315
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,260
the economics together so in particular

316
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:09,320
the more things they can sell that they

317
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,720
have chips in them the more money that

318
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,760
gives for companies and more incentive

319
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,650
that gives them to invest in research

320
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,410
and development to improve the

321
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:21,080
technology to buy it's a very expensive

322
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:24,110
capital equipment to run a semiconductor

323
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,360
fabrication facility and so that money

324
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,640
comes from ultimately because they're

325
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,530
selling this stuff and because of that

326
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,000
they're then able to improve the

327
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:36,280
technology pack more transistors

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,950
a chip make them run faster reduce the

329
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,990
power all those good things and then

330
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,060
that's coupled with people who are good

331
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,430
at a product design and of course the

332
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:48,760
software designers as well to improve

333
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:52,240
the product so that you want to buy more

334
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,910
stuff right and that causes more sales

335
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,970
so this cycle is very important that if

336
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,060
it weren't for that looping around then

337
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,590
these improvements wouldn't be happening

338
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,050
so right now the semiconductor industry

339
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,079
is worldwide it's very much a

340
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,550
international industry is about 300

341
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,120
billion dollars a year so it's pretty

342
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:15,490
big and so what does that meant well one

343
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,520
is simply let's just take the example of

344
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:23,920
phones that the iPhone the first iPhone

345
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:25,839
was on 2007 or so and there's been nine

346
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,459
generations of them including the most

347
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,780
recent which isn't shown this picture

348
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:34,180
and so more or less every year they come

349
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,980
out with a new phone and for example

350
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,180
this phone I'm carrying around is one I

351
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,160
bought this fall even though I had a

352
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:46,870
phone of from two years ago that was

353
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,730
really okay but I was sufficiently

354
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,220
motivated to shell out the money and now

355
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:55,570
it's not hidden in our plans anymore so

356
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:59,860
I know this actually cost me $750 but I

357
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:02,350
and many of my friends and people around

358
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:05,650
the world did exactly that and created a

359
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:08,350
huge pile of of cash that infused Apple

360
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:10,720
and part of the reason Apple now is the

361
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:14,410
largest company in the world in terms of

362
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:18,370
market capitalization so that cycle you

363
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:20,890
can see here you know better products

364
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,410
more sales you you see that happening

365
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,870
all the time but underneath it all

366
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:30,400
what's driving that then is the ability

367
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:33,760
to improve these products so you've

368
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,130
probably heard the other kind of stuff

369
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,340
people are talking about is artificial

370
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:43,690
intelligence and we'll it basically

371
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,460
eliminate all your jobs and the famous

372
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,380
sort of person behind that it's a guy

373
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,940
named Ray Kurzweil

374
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:54,400
um and so he proposed this idea they

375
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,910
called a singularity which is the the

376
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,490
day

377
00:18:54,910 --> 00:19:00,870
this is I'll just describe it to you can

378
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:04,030
tell I'm skeptic on this the day that

379
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:06,760
computers become more powerful than

380
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,430
humans actually that he's not the one

381
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,480
who invented that term then it's all of

382
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:14,560
a sudden going to create this massive

383
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,950
switchover where the computers are going

384
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:23,340
to get smarter by teaching themselves to

385
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:26,050
be smarter and sort off into infinity of

386
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:29,160
making humans obsolete that's the idea

387
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:31,990
of the singularity and part of the

388
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,620
argument behind this is basically from

389
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,890
moore's law

390
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:38,770
so what Crick's well did in this picture

391
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:41,560
and it actually started with some work

392
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:46,030
by a person who used to be the robotics

393
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:48,700
Institute here was he plotted based on

394
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,710
this his measure was calculations per

395
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,660
second per thousand dollars so how much

396
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:56,280
computation could you buy for a thousand

397
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,630
dollars and he started back in 1900 with

398
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:02,230
mechanical adding machines and stuff

399
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:06,670
like that and added these plots you see

400
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:11,590
this was around 2000 and somehow this is

401
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:13,300
an article of amazing a potting he

402
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,510
figured that this wasn't even a straight

403
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:21,010
line it was an upward curve so an upward

404
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:24,100
curve on a semi-log paper is more than

405
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:26,200
exponential it's like e to the x squared

406
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:30,160
or something like that right

407
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:34,000
so but anyways based on that projection

408
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,850
and based on some notion of the relative

409
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,390
power of human versus Mouse versus

410
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,990
insect brains he came out with this

411
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:45,130
projection that in 2030 roughly

412
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:49,390
computers would become smarter than

413
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:51,460
humans and if you just keep that on Kim

414
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:56,020
eight computers would become smarter

415
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,900
than all humans combined so that we can

416
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,940
talk about this projection and I'm sure

417
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:04,570
you guys do at times too

418
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,550
but my point of it is this argument it's

419
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,510
fundamentally a Moore's Law argument

420
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:11,950
right that the argument is basically as

421
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:15,030
computational power increases because of

422
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:17,890
this continuing progress of technology

423
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,750
it's inevitable that because humans

424
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,740
aren't really getting smarter much of a

425
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:25,420
very fast rate that it's inevitable that

426
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,520
computers will become smarter than

427
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,320
humans said Souter the argument but it's

428
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,210
very much based on this assumption that

429
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,760
computer technology is going to continue

430
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:40,120
to progress at an exponential pace

431
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,880
so let's now imagine and this is

432
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,090
something that you know you could be

433
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,870
thinking about is is what will this mean

434
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,600
50 years from now

435
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:52,360
so if Moore's law looks back over the

436
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,700
past 50 years now let's look forward for

437
00:21:52,360 --> 00:22:01,450
another 50 years and see what that would

438
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:05,470
mean and what would possibly be so one

439
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:07,030
claim I'll make is that whatever is the

440
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,100
most important thing it will be

441
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,520
something that is in the hands of

442
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:15,040
everyone or is even more ubiquitous than

443
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,810
there are humans on the planet right in

444
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,340
other words that what I claim is the

445
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:22,090
thing that will be the most important

446
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:26,260
technology wise will be what's the

447
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:29,020
largest volume product so I'm not sure

448
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:32,110
what that will be in 2065 it certainly

449
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:35,290
will not be called a cell phone it will

450
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:38,920
look like what we think is a phone after

451
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:41,410
all of all the things people own cell

452
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:47,170
phones for what do you use it for the

453
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:51,010
least making calls right Reese for me so

454
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:53,230
who knows what it will be but I claim

455
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:55,120
that and this is a key part of this

456
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:58,870
argument that I claim it's got to be a

457
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,510
portable low power system so it has to

458
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:04,060
be powerful computation but has to be

459
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,350
physically small and it can't draw much

460
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,919
power

461
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,450
and that will be and so it might be you

462
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,820
know the Internet of Things where

463
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,250
everything is networked together and

464
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,220
there's computer chips or various chips

465
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,200
and everything that those kind of things

466
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:25,659
would also have the kind of volumes

467
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,970
needed to drive the market forward so

468
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:31,070
based on that sort of let's make that

469
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,679
one part of assumption is whatever

470
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:36,950
drives the future it's going to be

471
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,950
something that is portable low power and

472
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,929
low cost you know consumer grade or

473
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,480
something that you can afford to just

474
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:46,759
sprinkle across the whole planet or

475
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,700
across the whole galaxy if we're beyond

476
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:51,049
Earth at that point so that means for

477
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,940
example that it's not going to be a

478
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:55,279
quantum computer right

479
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,720
quantum cholesterol to make

480
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:01,190
breakthroughs in superconducting

481
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,029
something that you have to cool down to

482
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:07,789
near absolute zero requires a big room a

483
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:11,659
lot of equipment and a lot of power and

484
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:13,039
a lot of things to manage it so you're

485
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:16,190
not going to carry that around in your

486
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,809
pocket I can promise you that so all the

487
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,789
people talking about a quantum computer

488
00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:22,009
well we can just rule that out that's

489
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:29,330
not going to be the the most important

490
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:30,860
thing out there but it and it also you

491
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:35,679
know if you could imagine building this

492
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:37,700
huge machine that occupies many acres of

493
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,350
buildings that's not going to be the

494
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,049
most exciting thing out there because

495
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,539
it's it there's not enough of those to

496
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:46,009
sort of drive the market and without

497
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:49,879
that market there won't be in the

498
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:52,100
investment in the technology so it has

499
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:53,899
to be inexpensive and what if we think

500
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,620
of it in computer science terms big

501
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:59,899
o-notation it can't be you know the cost

502
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,720
to produce these things can't be very

503
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:05,830
much so for example the chip that's in

504
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,159
the cell phone that Apple AAA costs

505
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:12,529
somewhere between ten and twenty dollars

506
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:14,750
for Apple to procure that from its

507
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:18,120
suppliers which are in Taiwan and in

508
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:21,280
Korea so they're not very expensive

509
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,410
that said it need not be anything based

510
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,510
on the technology we use today as I

511
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:29,770
mentioned currently things are CMOS and

512
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:33,039
it's been some kind of moss MOS since

513
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:35,169
the 1970s so for a long time but

514
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,880
probably won't continue to be that way

515
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:39,220
at least not in the way we know it and

516
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,429
these various other ideas people have

517
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:44,289
had for future computer technology that

518
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:48,340
beyond this and some of it's being

519
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:51,549
worked on here at CMU and I won't

520
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,289
predict what those could be but they

521
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:55,870
have to have these characteristics has

522
00:25:53,289 --> 00:26:03,520
to be inexpensive has being low-power

523
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:05,320
has to be scalable so that's my one

524
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,390
assumption then I'm going to add is

525
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,789
whatever it is we're going to want a lot

526
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,929
of them a lot of transistors or devices

527
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:16,240
of some sort so what does that mean if

528
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:19,059
we project that out in terms of how many

529
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,880
devices are on a chip not not how many

530
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:23,950
transistors four devices so one great

531
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,890
thing about semi-log pots is you can

532
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,960
just extrapolate to your heart's content

533
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:31,750
so if we just run those two curves that

534
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,450
I showed you before out you get

535
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,549
somewhere we'll just you know pick a

536
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,980
number that sort of roughly in the

537
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:45,610
middle of those two projections of 10 to

538
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:49,690
the 17th so 10 to the 17th things

539
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:53,169
devices in a single integrated system of

540
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:56,289
some kind and that would be what we'd be

541
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:58,539
looking at so how big is 10 to the 17th

542
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:00,730
well if we go back to our sand analogy

543
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:03,370
this is a picture I found on the

544
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,460
internet of some young man in Brazil on

545
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:11,559
a beach making a scale model of the

546
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:15,460
Empire State Building out of sand so my

547
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:17,980
estimate is this is roughly something

548
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,230
like 3 billion grains of sand in that

549
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:24,010
thing I didn't count them I have didn't

550
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:26,200
yet but so so think in terms so

551
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,179
something you know roughly the same

552
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,950
scale I showed you of those 4 bags of

553
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,720
sand from Home Depot something that's

554
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,570
roughly comparable

555
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,400
what we'd get on a chip today if if

556
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,250
transistors were the size of a grain of

557
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,280
sand so what does 10 to the 17th mean

558
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:44,530
well if you actually built a sand model

559
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:48,760
of the Empire State Building that

560
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:51,640
one-to-one scale right then that's a

561
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:55,780
million cubic meters and then if you

562
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,460
made two replicas of that then and some

563
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:01,110
of those three together then you'd get

564
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,970
about 10 to the 17th grains of sand so

565
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,530
of course we're assuming this is going

566
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,330
to be something a lot more than a grain

567
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,179
of sand but just to give you a sense of

568
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:14,110
scale of how big a change that would be

569
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:17,169
going from a few billion to 10 to the

570
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:23,950
17th is a pretty big jump in terms of

571
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:26,260
how many devices are involved so let's

572
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:29,320
figure out how could we make things you

573
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:32,200
know let's just say well let's just try

574
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,940
running the numbers and seeing what

575
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,190
would happen if we just took our current

576
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:39,700
technology which is more or less what

577
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:41,970
we've been using since 1970 of putting a

578
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,770
lot of transistors on a single chip

579
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:50,919
actually I happen to bring some toys

580
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:53,890
with me today this is a wafer so this is

581
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:57,390
what comes through a fabrication plant

582
00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:00,130
and it's got typically about 700

583
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:03,370
individuals whether they called I on

584
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:05,020
them but then they slice up and they put

585
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,679
in packages so these are some old

586
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,960
packages but now on your phone or your

587
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:14,970
laptops whose packaging in there so they

588
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,620
package the the chips inside of there so

589
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:21,700
typically then this is the current size

590
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:24,429
that a company manufactures a diet at 30

591
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:29,350
centimeters so about 1 foot in diameter

592
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:31,539
and you get about 700 chips on it to

593
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:35,350
typically around one square centimeter

594
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:38,320
so let's just say well let's just take

595
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:41,890
that technology which over the years

596
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,530
these these die of these chips have

597
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,159
gotten the wafers have gotten bigger the

598
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,349
die

599
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:49,179
gotten a little bit bigger and we've

600
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:53,200
also been able to make much finer

601
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:56,979
geometries on these chips so let's sort

602
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,779
of see how we've got this over history

603
00:29:56,979 --> 00:30:04,059
and what the projections of that would

604
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:05,919
mean and what the data show is that the

605
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:09,460
way we've achieved is sort of doubling

606
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,769
every two years in how many transistors

607
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,769
were on a chip is one the trips have

608
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:17,649
gotten bigger they've doubled in size

609
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:19,359
the rate of once every ten years and

610
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:23,169
also the geometries have gotten finer

611
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:25,809
that we've they've doubled in size or

612
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:29,499
halved in size where the density we can

613
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:34,419
get as a result has gone by a factor to

614
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:36,009
every about four times in ten years and

615
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:38,590
so you sum those up you get five

616
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:43,419
doublings every ten years and that's how

617
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:46,779
you get Moore's law so in particular if

618
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:49,029
you look at the earliest chip the four

619
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:51,190
thousand four was about twelve square

620
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:55,389
millimeters so that it's pretty small

621
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:58,929
and a modern chip is typically around a

622
00:30:55,389 --> 00:31:04,029
square centimeter so and this is

623
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:06,009
actually to scale to a dime there are

624
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,659
some bigger chips out there and they're

625
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:11,440
not really blue they just did this to

626
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:15,539
make it look nice but IBM for example

627
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,889
makes a server where the chip size is

628
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:22,299
almost ten times larger than than this

629
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:25,330
processor so you can get some pretty big

630
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:28,210
dye out there but those are typically

631
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:30,460
only and also some GPUs can be pretty

632
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:32,440
big dot so those are used either in

633
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,229
servers or in places where they're

634
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,090
pretty specialized for more portable

635
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:41,919
battery-powered things you have to go

636
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:44,979
with smaller chips so this is the data

637
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,529
showing the area for these different

638
00:31:44,979 --> 00:31:49,210
micro processors for time and you can

639
00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:52,619
see that you're kind of all over the map

640
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:55,509
so it's a little risky to do any kind of

641
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:57,849
extrapolation here but this is where I

642
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:58,710
got the number that it's doubled roughly

643
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:03,010
every ten

644
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:06,450
the area of the chip so if we project

645
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:09,820
that out then then we get something of

646
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:11,380
173 square centimeters so those of you

647
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,350
metrically challenge that number

648
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,420
probably doesn't mean much to you but

649
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:20,500
just to give you a sense like if I just

650
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:25,020
extrapolated then by the Year 2065 I

651
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:31,420
should be up to the Apple model a 59

652
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:34,240
because right today's a 6s and so

653
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:37,300
anyways and it will as we said 10 to the

654
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,790
17 transistors that will be 173 square

655
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,250
centimeters the problem with that is

656
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:45,940
it's actually bigger than a dollar bill

657
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:47,980
it's about two dollar bills in size 173

658
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,010
square centimeters and you're not going

659
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,770
to fit that in your pocket

660
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:55,450
notice you have really big pocket so

661
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:58,240
that is not the way things are going to

662
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:00,360
work we can't just keep scaling up area

663
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,400
and expect that to happen

664
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,560
well the other factor which is we showed

665
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,560
is more critical as things have gotten

666
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:11,700
smaller and so the way I'll I'll measure

667
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:16,450
that is I'll take this measure I call L

668
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:20,110
the linear metric of of chip density

669
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:22,570
I'll say the area of that chip divided

670
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,950
by the number of transistors and so one

671
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,930
way to think about it is if the

672
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:29,920
transistors are spread in a sort of

673
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:32,560
uniform grid across a chip then their

674
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,690
spacing would be this number L of course

675
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,310
they're not there they're denser in some

676
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,840
places and more spread out and others

677
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:40,870
but sort of if you think of this as a

678
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:45,280
way to look overall how close we packed

679
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:49,120
our transistors to each other and this

680
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:51,160
is the curve you get from our existing

681
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,310
set of processors and you see this one

682
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,140
really is a pretty strong trend of

683
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:58,650
getting a finer and finer geometries

684
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,650
over time

685
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:08,690
and it's so the linear scale it drops by

686
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:11,929
a factor of two every five years but if

687
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:15,619
you think about the number of things the

688
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:21,520
density therefore goes by a factor of

689
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:23,569
four every five years and so that or

690
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,839
equivalently I've gotten twice as many

691
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:29,440
transistors in a given area every two

692
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,440
and a half years

693
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:40,099
and we can see that again in practice

694
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:45,220
that if you measure out for the Intel

695
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:48,109
4004 it comes out to 72,000 nanometers

696
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:52,280
10 to the ninth meters is this measure

697
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:54,800
and where's EPEL a 8 is 211 nanometers

698
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,740
so those you know about chip technology

699
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:02,900
might know that the AAA was manufactured

700
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:06,920
with what's called a 22 nanometer

701
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:09,650
process so when they measure when you

702
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,750
hear people talking about a process you

703
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,790
know the actual fabrication process and

704
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:15,970
they give a number of nowadays and

705
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:18,530
nanometers what I mean it's a sort of

706
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:21,220
closest spacing you can make two wires

707
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:24,589
on a chip sort of finest geometry there

708
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:27,500
but this measure L is bigger because it

709
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:30,260
accounts for not just out what you how

710
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,630
closely you can pack wires but all the

711
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,609
other stuff you have to put transistors

712
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,980
there you have to route power and ground

713
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:38,839
and signal wires to them and they have

714
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,910
to be isolated from each other so this

715
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:46,160
is actually a more useful measure of of

716
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:49,250
the effect of spacing on a chip um so

717
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,950
just to again if you're not so familiar

718
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:55,730
with this kind of geometry let's just

719
00:35:51,950 --> 00:36:00,470
give you some idea of it so this range

720
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:02,869
in nanometers then between a thousand

721
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:05,180
and a million then is sort of something

722
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:08,240
smaller than a millimeter right a

723
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,730
million nanometers is a millimeter so a

724
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,450
thousand nanometers is a micron or a

725
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:17,420
micrometer and so this range which is

726
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:22,160
where some any conductor processing was

727
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:24,740
up till ten years ago you'd call it the

728
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,339
submillimetre range and in this it's in

729
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:30,760
the sub micrometer range so just to give

730
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:33,200
you some sense of what those scales mean

731
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,150
and I'll point out that it's pretty

732
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,420
incredible to talk about something over

733
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:40,609
six orders of magnitude in scale right

734
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,900
that's in the physical world six orders

735
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:45,240
of magnitude is a law

736
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,150
so again if you look at here's some

737
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:52,890
examples of things of how big is a

738
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:56,549
micrometer often called a micron so you

739
00:36:52,890 --> 00:37:00,480
know things that the are almost visible

740
00:36:56,549 --> 00:37:05,670
at this scale a human cell how thick a

741
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:11,039
piece of plastic saran wrap is how thick

742
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:14,430
a a strand of spider silk is gives you

743
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:16,970
some rough number and so this Intel chip

744
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:21,930
from the seventies was somewhere in that

745
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:25,160
range and now if we look somewhere

746
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:28,980
between a nanometer and a mic micrometer

747
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:32,130
and again this is a log pot or so these

748
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:35,520
things go pretty fast so for example all

749
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:40,049
a visible light is in this range between

750
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:42,089
400 and 700 nanometers and the spacing

751
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:44,640
of transistors on an Apple chip are

752
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:48,089
therefore closer than then the

753
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,069
wavelength of visible light by the way

754
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:54,119
which makes for kind of a challenge for

755
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:56,609
manufacturing something like how thick

756
00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:00,059
is a cell membrane or how what's the

757
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:02,970
diameter of a strand of DNA are down in

758
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:05,250
just a few nanometer range what they

759
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:08,069
call carbon Namek nanotubes which people

760
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,260
predict will be possibly a successor to

761
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:14,730
transistors their diameter not their

762
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:17,069
length is one nanometer so those are

763
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:20,849
pretty small when you're getting down

764
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:22,650
here and nowadays modern processes

765
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:27,319
they're trying to create features down

766
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:31,529
in this range of 14 nanometers example

767
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:34,950
okay but we can do our plot and if you

768
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:39,690
just project out you'll get down to this

769
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:42,420
linear spacing of 230 Pico meters in 50

770
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:43,609
years so what does that mean how big is

771
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,440
a Pico meter

772
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:48,510
well Pico meter is really small in fact

773
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:54,690
if you look at the spacing between two

774
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:56,670
atoms in a silicon crystal they're about

775
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,190
half of a nanometer

776
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:02,720
and if you look at the spacing between

777
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:07,740
the two atoms in a hydrogen molecule

778
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,960
there are 74 picometers so what the main

779
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,420
thing to realize is this ain't going to

780
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,670
happen there is absolutely no way that

781
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:18,329
we'll be able to create systems where

782
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:20,910
things are spaced only 230 Miko meters

783
00:39:18,329 --> 00:39:22,650
apart right because presumably whatever

784
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:28,440
we build is going to be bigger than a

785
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:33,630
hydrogen atom or molecule so or you know

786
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:35,490
so this really is not in the range of

787
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,010
physically possible and that's one of

788
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:40,319
the annoying things that physics has

789
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:45,089
sort of gotten in the way of progress

790
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:48,660
recently so in particular you know could

791
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:51,720
we imagine then let's just suppose we'll

792
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:55,190
allow a chip we'll say let's go to chip

793
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:58,740
be as big as 400 square millimetres just

794
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:02,309
about twice as big on a side as the

795
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:05,460
current chip current standard chip that

796
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:11,660
would still require this spacing metric

797
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:13,079
of 63 Pico meters in this isn't right

798
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,750
yeah

799
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,420
because I'm not allowed to make chips to

800
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:22,500
the size of $2 bills

801
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:27,059
so it requires even finer spacing here

802
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:30,269
and we saw that's just 63 Pico meters is

803
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:32,549
actually closer than the two atoms in a

804
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:35,569
hydrogen molecule the two nuclei in a

805
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:35,569
hydrogen molecule

806
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,920
so the answer is no this isn't going to

807
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:44,170
happen this just playing is not possible

808
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,390
at least not you know so we have to back

809
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:48,190
off and say well what's our defect our

810
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,390
thinking one is to assume that we're

811
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:53,200
going to just take this current

812
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:57,880
technology of two-dimensional things and

813
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,290
just shrink it and one reason we look at

814
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,190
that way because that's exactly what's

815
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:05,109
happened over the past 50 years but we

816
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,380
have three dimensions in this world and

817
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:11,950
so maybe there's some prospect there so

818
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:16,480
let's say instead okay let's imagine a

819
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:18,640
little brick of stuff and I'll just make

820
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,400
up some numbers I'll say 2 centimeters

821
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,000
on a side and 5 millimeters high it's

822
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:31,119
almost exactly the same shape and volume

823
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:34,990
as a stack of five nickels and so and

824
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,570
now let's just imagine okay how are we

825
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:39,250
going to integrate a bunch of things

826
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:43,390
well presumably we're going to build it

827
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:46,060
out of layers and so let's just assume

828
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:48,849
that there's about a hundred thousand

829
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:50,859
layers worth of stuff and those are what

830
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:55,660
I'll call logical layers meaning that

831
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:58,330
they'll be about a million physical

832
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,880
layers because we have to have wires and

833
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:04,300
these whatever we're building will be

834
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:09,960
just these totally flat things nowadays

835
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:16,720
there's a modern chip has more like 20

836
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:18,010
physical layers on it so but the point

837
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,080
is that we'll have to have about a

838
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:23,099
million physical layers worth of stuff

839
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:27,030
to get a hundred thousand logical layers

840
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:31,300
but that would allow us a spacing on the

841
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:34,810
linear spacing of about 20 nanometers so

842
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:38,950
20 nanometers is a lot better than a 63

843
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:43,750
picometers right if we go back 20

844
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:46,900
nanometers is up in here so it's really

845
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:49,930
really small but it's not

846
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:52,060
it's not beyond a physical possibility

847
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:54,670
which is put it that way so you could

848
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:57,880
imagine some technology that would give

849
00:42:54,670 --> 00:43:02,080
you that so at least at some level it

850
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:07,150
it's vaguely you know it's aggressive

851
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:10,660
but but possible to imagine in 50 years

852
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:13,300
be able to manufacture in a shape like

853
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:18,970
that something with 10 to the 17th

854
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:21,970
devices but there's a few problems one

855
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:23,490
is actually the manufacturing how we do

856
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:26,020
actually do this is no small thing

857
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:28,510
another I'll talk about some is how do

858
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,280
we do this and not spend a whole lot and

859
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:32,980
exorbitant amount of money doing it and

860
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,910
the other is a huge huge problem of

861
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:39,550
power consumption how can we actually

862
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:41,920
have a system that complicated and keep

863
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:44,740
it at the limited energy level we have

864
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,980
available so let me go into that some

865
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:50,110
more so just is a sort of tutorial the

866
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,300
way these chips are made and part of the

867
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:56,410
reason they're so cheap is it's sort of

868
00:43:52,300 --> 00:44:00,760
a photo process meaning that every step

869
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:03,430
of the way is done by putting a some

870
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:08,830
kind of material down and exposing it to

871
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:10,090
a light a laser light and then that this

872
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:13,390
material that you've put down is

873
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:15,280
light-sensitive and so there's a mask

874
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,730
that defines how things should be

875
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:21,460
patterned and the white only hits where

876
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:24,070
the mask is allows it to and that's how

877
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,650
you get different shapes and things and

878
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:28,960
you can either add material or you can

879
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:31,570
remove material by these masking steps

880
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,770
so nowadays the modern chip takes about

881
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:38,470
60 of these steps we're involving a mask

882
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:40,450
and some type of either depositing

883
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:44,500
something or removing something or

884
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:48,640
shining light on it or a beam of ions or

885
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:51,480
some other process step to do it so it's

886
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,040
very complicated than the technology is

887
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:59,680
quite remarkable but what you could say

888
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:00,800
is that the even though there's a couple

889
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,920
billion transit

890
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,050
she's on a chip it still is a constant

891
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,530
time process some fixed number of steps

892
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:12,200
and it's done and Beach successive

893
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:13,940
generation maybe the number of masking

894
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,780
steps has increased a little bit over

895
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:21,140
time but roughly speaking it's always a

896
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:24,590
constant time operation and it turns out

897
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:26,690
that the bottleneck in this and the

898
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:31,010
performance one is actually this

899
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:35,150
photolithography exposing the chip the

900
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:37,880
the wafer using a mask and the way

901
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:41,660
that's done nowadays is a machine called

902
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:45,470
a stepper that basically is used to scan

903
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:49,580
over the wafer and expose with a laser

904
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:54,650
sort of flashing as it goes to expose

905
00:45:49,580 --> 00:46:00,730
the wafer to this mask and so current

906
00:45:54,650 --> 00:46:00,730
day that's done it up on a size of about

907
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,200
eight hundred nine hundred square

908
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,280
millimeters so you know about this

909
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:13,130
bigger size how much they can expose at

910
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,810
a time and the fastest steppers out

911
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:17,270
there can do a whole way for in eighteen

912
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:21,370
seconds which is pretty good if you

913
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:24,020
think of waving over this whole area

914
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:27,680
flashing and exposing it with extremely

915
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:32,810
high resolution and very high alignment

916
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:35,450
of reliability so but that's sort of the

917
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:38,060
thing that sort of limits how many chips

918
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:41,690
you can run through a fabrication

919
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:43,280
facility per day is this stepper and the

920
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:46,370
stepper is the most expensive piece of

921
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,590
machinery in the building so you don't

922
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:51,160
want to buy a whole lot of them so

923
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:53,720
that's sort of my point is that

924
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,880
lithography is the expensive thing so

925
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,970
every layer we have to do if we have to

926
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:02,210
expose it using this technique is

927
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:05,960
expensive and so there's no way you

928
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:08,480
could do a million layer system using

929
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,870
photo lithography and keep the expense

930
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,640
down to the range where it would be

931
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,510
something you or I would would be able

932
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,360
to afford

933
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:19,070
as a consumer device as I said a modern

934
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,040
chip is somewhere between 10 and 20

935
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:25,970
dollars so we're not talking a lot of

936
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:28,490
money like well if you increase that

937
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:30,020
cost by a hundred then people aren't

938
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:32,900
going to buy it because if you think

939
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:37,240
it's a ten dollar chip powers at $700

940
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:40,010
phone then of these big multiplier there

941
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,020
so there's various options you can

942
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,750
imagine one is what they call chemical

943
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:48,140
self-assembly where basically whatever

944
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:51,530
you're having sort of patterns itself

945
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:53,990
just like the crystals would in a you

946
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:56,120
know in a block of or something like

947
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:58,760
that if you can imagine various chemical

948
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:01,430
processes where things just form into

949
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,760
the particulars aped so this is an area

950
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:06,890
that's been tried and worked on for

951
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,690
electronics for several decades and

952
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:12,080
never really succeeded yet but maybe

953
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:17,080
that's possible and another possibility

954
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:20,090
would be some interesting ideas in in

955
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:25,190
multiple working with multiple layers at

956
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:26,900
once so in particular one technology

957
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:29,960
that's really been able to scale into

958
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:32,660
three dimensions are flash chips and

959
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,030
that's part of the reason why my phone

960
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:37,880
has 64 gigabytes I'm not bragging I'm

961
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:40,280
just telling you my phone has 64

962
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,410
gigabytes of memory you know why is

963
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,380
there so much memory a flash memory

964
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:48,350
available on a quest as you know is sort

965
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:52,040
of the storage of choice in a

966
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:57,250
solid-state disk on cell phones nowadays

967
00:48:52,040 --> 00:49:01,010
and so it's a it's based on

968
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:05,390
semiconductor devices so for example

969
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:08,480
this is a electron micrograph of a chip

970
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:13,330
from samsung showing how they are able

971
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:17,780
to create a sort of three-dimensional

972
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:24,230
layering of memory cells so basically

973
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:26,900
every spot in x y&z here is a one bits

974
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:30,230
where it's actually two bits worth of

975
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:33,619
of memory cell and there's some device

976
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:35,630
there that can store it and then there's

977
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:40,069
ways that you can access it to either

978
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:43,520
read it or write it and they're able to

979
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:47,119
do with this whole layering but by using

980
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,829
only a fixed number of masking steps so

981
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,799
basically what they start off with is

982
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:56,000
they build up layers without any masking

983
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:58,039
and then they put some masks there and

984
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,690
then they zap down and they can sort of

985
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:05,900
carve away of using basically ion beams

986
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:08,150
to carve down wherever the mask is and

987
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:11,029
pattern things then they can pour

988
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:15,880
various types of goop in there that will

989
00:50:11,029 --> 00:50:18,500
fill up these spaces and so by some

990
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,589
patterning only at the very top layer

991
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:24,880
they can actually create this

992
00:50:20,589 --> 00:50:29,059
three-dimensional matrix of memory cells

993
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:31,010
and they can now the most recent

994
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:33,140
technology gets about 48 layers and

995
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:34,549
there's projections that they'll be able

996
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,859
to keep doing that at least through

997
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:39,559
several hundred layers so my point is

998
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:42,170
that you can actually do you don't

999
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:45,589
necessarily need to do masking at every

1000
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:49,819
single layer to create a 3-dimensional

1001
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:52,789
structure now this doesn't scale in an

1002
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:54,529
obvious way to computers or

1003
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:57,470
microprocessors or anything with

1004
00:50:54,529 --> 00:51:00,760
computation it relies very heavily on

1005
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:07,130
the fact that the particular circuit of

1006
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:09,859
flash memory is very simple and fairly

1007
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:12,529
easy to build in this 3-dimensional

1008
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:14,660
structure but at least this is the kind

1009
00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:15,829
of idea of what will have to happen if

1010
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,220
we're going to get this kind of

1011
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:18,220
integration

1012
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:25,910
but here's the harder one and this is a

1013
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:29,269
problem just in general we're already up

1014
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:35,029
against the serious power issues now so

1015
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:38,239
if I look at a modern phone the only

1016
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:40,999
drawers even when it's sort of working

1017
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:43,579
hardest a couple of watts typically when

1018
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:46,400
it's just if you want to walk around if

1019
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:49,700
you want to have the battery be good for

1020
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:54,559
a day at a time it has to draw a lot

1021
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:56,029
less power than that so typically when

1022
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,709
your phones and standby it's only

1023
00:51:56,029 --> 00:52:04,219
drawing a few of a few milliwatts so

1024
00:52:00,709 --> 00:52:06,019
maybe a hundredth of a watt but when it

1025
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:08,839
needs to like you've just taken a

1026
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:10,640
picture and it wants to do some image

1027
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:13,309
processing on it or you're taking a

1028
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:17,809
video or something like that it can

1029
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:20,119
crank up to a couple watts of power so

1030
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:21,769
why can't it go more than that one is as

1031
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:25,190
I mentioned is the battery but the other

1032
00:52:21,769 --> 00:52:27,140
is if your phone draws more than a few

1033
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:28,579
watts then you won't really want to walk

1034
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,619
around with it in your pocket because

1035
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:33,259
it'll be too hot so you know just

1036
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:35,989
imagine a 25 watt light bulb if you put

1037
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:38,289
that in your pocket and walked around as

1038
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:40,249
far as the extension cord would let you

1039
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:44,660
that wouldn't feel too good

1040
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:47,239
so that limits the power isn't just

1041
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:49,219
battery what so even if we come up with

1042
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:52,579
better bed resources the other thing is

1043
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:56,209
cooling so contrast that to the human

1044
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:59,690
brain is actually pretty amazing as a

1045
00:52:56,209 --> 00:53:03,729
low power system so a human brain

1046
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:08,059
contains roughly 64 billion neurons up

1047
00:53:03,729 --> 00:53:14,059
but it and it draws a few tens of watts

1048
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:15,769
so more there's reasons than that so

1049
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:17,900
it's a higher powered thing than a phone

1050
00:53:15,769 --> 00:53:20,509
but it's still a very low power system

1051
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,849
so high power it's partly that's a

1052
00:53:20,509 --> 00:53:26,509
liquid-cooled system your brain circular

1053
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:28,430
your body circulation system puts a lot

1054
00:53:26,509 --> 00:53:31,449
of its work into keeping your brain from

1055
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:33,359
overheating and your body's metabolism

1056
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:35,489
are you

1057
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:37,910
for example you guys sitting here each

1058
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:41,160
of you are drawing about sixty watts so

1059
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:43,289
you like a 60 watt light bulb but about

1060
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,839
a quarter of that power is is powering

1061
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:48,390
the neurons in your brain so it's a

1062
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:51,410
fairly big chunk of the human energy

1063
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:53,819
budget is the brain which makes sense

1064
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:56,039
but it's still more power than we're

1065
00:53:53,819 --> 00:54:00,269
really going to allow in our portable

1066
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:06,829
devices if we don't want to our pits to

1067
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:11,039
catch on fire and now the crazy thing is

1068
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:14,160
but wait a minute I wanted to go up to

1069
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:16,859
10 to the 17th of these devices five

1070
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,619
hundred thousand times more and I don't

1071
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:21,690
want to add any more power to this so

1072
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:23,249
how is that going to happen well it's

1073
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,489
certainly not going to happen with the

1074
00:54:23,249 --> 00:54:28,079
technology we have today that just can't

1075
00:54:25,489 --> 00:54:30,769
possibly meet those so we'll have to

1076
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,119
have some fairly radically different

1077
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:36,299
technology from a power perspective as

1078
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:38,910
well and misko is also not just for

1079
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:41,999
portable devices but even room size

1080
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:44,759
building sized computers for example

1081
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:47,130
right now the fastest computer in the

1082
00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:50,369
u.s. is at Oak Ridge National Labs

1083
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:55,309
it's called Titan a fastest in the world

1084
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:55,309
it's in China and both of them draw

1085
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:07,670
roughly 10 megawatts okay of power so

1086
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:12,349
the high-end supercomputers and one of

1087
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:14,059
the goals that the supercomputing people

1088
00:55:12,349 --> 00:55:16,730
talked about is to scale to what they

1089
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:20,150
call exascale meaning the ability to do

1090
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:21,980
10 to the 18th operations per second

1091
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:24,230
whether they call flops floating-point

1092
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,630
operations per second so if you just

1093
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:28,999
took Titan and said okay we want to make

1094
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:34,249
it go a hundred times faster we'll just

1095
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:38,509
put more so for example a Titan is built

1096
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:42,049
out of 28,000 microprocessors and 28,000

1097
00:55:38,509 --> 00:55:47,380
GPUs so if we just go crank all that up

1098
00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:47,380
by a factor of 100 then you're talking

1099
00:55:47,529 --> 00:55:54,619
close to gigawatt of power so and just

1100
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:57,470
roughly in rough terms the entire output

1101
00:55:54,619 --> 00:56:01,119
of the Hoover Dam is is would be enough

1102
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:03,559
to power a 1 gigawatt system so our

1103
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,440
small nuclear power plant could do it

1104
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:09,650
too but the point is power is going to

1105
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:12,799
be a big issue for both portable things

1106
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:18,519
and for all of computing as we go

1107
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:21,440
forward ok so that's sort of some of the

1108
00:56:18,519 --> 00:56:24,109
technical challenges accommodation but

1109
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,710
another is an economic challenge is that

1110
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:32,359
it turns out that semiconductor business

1111
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:36,460
has become more capital intensive and

1112
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:40,640
harder to to sustain and so this is a

1113
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:43,119
example of all the companies that we're

1114
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:46,700
able to manufacture chips at different

1115
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:50,839
physical sizes so that it's a little bit

1116
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:54,559
out of date the the latest chips are are

1117
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:56,839
14 nanometers but you see that we're

1118
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:59,180
basically down to four companies in the

1119
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:01,809
world who have the wherewithal to

1120
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:06,799
manufacture state-of-the-art

1121
00:57:01,809 --> 00:57:09,230
semiconductor systems and and so and

1122
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:11,340
these are just to let you know tsmc is

1123
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:16,320
Taiwan semiconductor manufacturer

1124
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:19,230
they're huge in producing chips for

1125
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:22,080
other customers basically what they call

1126
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:27,780
foundry so other designs come in so for

1127
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:30,480
example TSMC historically has been the

1128
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:33,650
main vendor for apple for almost all

1129
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:36,930
android phones are manufactured by tsmc

1130
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:40,550
intel you know intel but they very much

1131
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:43,470
rely completely for their business on on

1132
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:49,860
microprocessors and other things they

1133
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:51,810
are that and they only with a small

1134
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:54,920
exception only manufactured chips for

1135
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:58,260
their own use their own company

1136
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:01,710
samsung as you know is in korea is a

1137
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:04,290
leading manufacturer and a lot of what

1138
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:08,640
they do is produce chips for samsung

1139
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:11,790
products but they also are one of the

1140
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,370
biggest vendors of memory they also

1141
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:16,050
actually interestingly manufactures some

1142
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:18,510
of the chips for apples so if you think

1143
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:23,730
about the phone business who are the big

1144
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:25,800
competitors Samsung Apple but Samsung

1145
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:27,980
actually builds Apple's chips Apple has

1146
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,150
no manufacturing capabilities whatsoever

1147
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,310
and then the fourth one is the one

1148
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:35,480
called Global Foundries which is a

1149
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:40,800
company that sort of swept up all the

1150
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:43,980
second string players and it's actually

1151
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:48,750
owned by the sovereign wealth fund of

1152
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:53,490
the Abu Dhabi so one of the United Arab

1153
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:56,420
Emirates so really if you're you can

1154
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:59,760
think that there's two companies in Asia

1155
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:02,460
one that's headquartered in Abu Dhabi

1156
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,710
but it's actually physically other

1157
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:10,560
manufacturing facilities are in the u.s.

1158
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:12,660
in Germany and in Singapore Intel all of

1159
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,970
its manufacturing is in the u.s. Taiwan

1160
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:19,220
is at least through the leading edge all

1161
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:23,340
in Taiwan and Samsung they have a fab in

1162
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:24,150
Texas and in Korea so anyways my point

1163
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,400
is

1164
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:28,859
this isn't very many if you think of a

1165
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,380
300 billion dollar industry and sort of

1166
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:33,180
where we're betting our future on you

1167
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,589
only have four companies really that are

1168
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:37,680
in the business right now is a little

1169
00:59:34,589 --> 00:59:40,319
bit scary and as you see if this trend

1170
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:43,920
continues things wouldn't go well and

1171
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:46,140
particularly if we want innovation and

1172
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,170
progress to happen we need competition

1173
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:51,210
and if the number of companies dropped

1174
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:54,500
to small then the competition won't be

1175
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:58,190
as significant either so these are

1176
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,190
interesting questions

1177
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:06,530
another thing that making life difficult

1178
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:09,110
and it's been making life difficult for

1179
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:11,540
the last ten years is what sometimes

1180
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:14,090
referred to as Dennard scaling and this

1181
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:17,000
is a term that you'll hear said nowadays

1182
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:19,580
and just a few years ago if you

1183
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,500
mentioned that term people would have no

1184
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:24,290
idea what you're talking about unless

1185
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,650
you were pretty heavy into chips but

1186
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:30,080
there's a fellow named Robert Denard who

1187
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:33,590
had a long career at IBM he actually got

1188
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:36,710
his PhD here from Carnegie Tech in the

1189
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:37,910
1950s and among other things he invented

1190
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:42,920
the dynamic Ram

1191
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:46,490
so DRAM you know he's a guy but he wrote

1192
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:50,030
a very interesting paper in in 1974 that

1193
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:52,490
sort of sketched out why it is that by

1194
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:55,750
shrinking chips we a life gets better

1195
01:00:52,490 --> 01:01:00,050
and it's a very simple model sort of

1196
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:05,000
simple area geometry basics of Ohm's law

1197
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:08,210
kind of stuff that that tells you what

1198
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,260
it's doing but he said imagine we can

1199
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:15,770
shrink a chip all the features on a chip

1200
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:18,200
by a factor of some number K if you

1201
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:23,210
typically really say 2 or the square

1202
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:25,960
root of 2 so if you can shrink in both x

1203
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:29,780
and y directions by a factor of K and

1204
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:32,210
this is a big important hand and we also

1205
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:35,630
reduce the supply voltage to the chip by

1206
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:37,610
that same factor then obviously we're

1207
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:42,760
going to increase the number of devices

1208
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:45,410
by a factor of K squared right but also

1209
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:48,280
we'll be able to make these run faster

1210
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:51,830
and we'll be able to do it without

1211
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:55,250
requiring more power per chip so if all

1212
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:58,550
this scaling holds then we can get more

1213
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:01,180
stuff on a chip run it faster and not

1214
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:04,910
use more power so that sort of the

1215
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:07,820
principle of Dennard scaling and that's

1216
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:14,440
really what was followed by the industry

1217
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:19,810
for from about 75 to about

1218
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:22,130
2004 this is a chart that shows how

1219
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:24,890
technology progressed so the top curve

1220
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:29,450
here is Moore's law how many transistors

1221
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:34,250
were on a chip this next curve down was

1222
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:36,740
how fast could a microprocessor go

1223
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:40,510
running a single threat of execution and

1224
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:43,760
you see it was following a sort of nice

1225
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:45,950
steady growth curve what was the

1226
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,950
frequency the clock frequency of the

1227
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:51,260
chip you saw also followed this nice

1228
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:54,410
growth curve until it hit about two

1229
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:57,890
gigahertz how many watts per chip well

1230
01:02:54,410 --> 01:03:03,590
it's kind of variable but it was more or

1231
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:05,510
less it was going faster than Dennard

1232
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:09,290
scaling predicted but still pretty

1233
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:12,290
reasonable and how many cores would we

1234
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:13,730
put on a chip well it was one for a

1235
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:18,550
really long time and then they started

1236
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:22,580
anymore so the main point to notice is

1237
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:27,200
somewhere actually it was a right around

1238
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:29,660
2005 things stopped progressing Moore's

1239
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:33,080
law continues it continues today we can

1240
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:35,690
get more stuff on a chip than before but

1241
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:38,420
how fast a given thread goes has not

1242
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:41,120
really improved much in the past of 10

1243
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:43,610
years and that's why the shark machines

1244
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:49,150
which are already 5 years old are

1245
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:54,200
actually pretty viable computers which

1246
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:57,830
and the number of watts has leveled off

1247
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:00,020
not because that's the best thing

1248
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:06,200
computing wise but that's because you

1249
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:08,630
just can't afford to the cost of the

1250
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:12,470
actual electricity cost as well as all

1251
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:15,560
the requirements for cooling and things

1252
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:17,960
that comes with increased power and so

1253
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:21,020
that combination is the reason why we've

1254
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:24,260
gone multi-core that we couldn't get

1255
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:26,600
improved single-threaded performance but

1256
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,400
we could improve the number of

1257
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,410
transistors

1258
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:38,079
chip so what do we do we just make more

1259
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:40,839
cores and so my so so some will tell you

1260
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:43,329
that Moore's law is already dead in the

1261
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:45,099
sense that for a while there is a sort

1262
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:47,950
of miraculous things just kept getting

1263
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:50,230
better and better every year because of

1264
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:52,210
Moore's law and now we're already in an

1265
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:54,789
era that even though the transistor

1266
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:56,529
density part of Moore's law holds some

1267
01:04:54,789 --> 01:05:00,940
of these other performance factors have

1268
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:04,660
not improved so it's in getting

1269
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:08,430
difficult to sort of use this technology

1270
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:11,319
to make things faster and more powerful

1271
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:13,990
and so I'll mention for example part of

1272
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:15,309
the reason why this phone actually I

1273
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:17,799
don't know how many transistors are in

1274
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:19,809
this phone but if you think at two

1275
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:22,450
billion transistors the model before

1276
01:05:19,809 --> 01:05:24,400
that had 1 billion you say well what

1277
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:26,799
what are all these transistors doing

1278
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,779
part of what they've done is and part of

1279
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:32,859
the reason they're able to keep the

1280
01:05:28,779 --> 01:05:35,190
power down is a lot of what's on a they

1281
01:05:32,859 --> 01:05:37,450
call the the chip now it's not called a

1282
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:37,809
microprocessor it's called a system on a

1283
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:41,079
chip

1284
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:45,460
because embedded on it will be a couple

1285
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:48,880
of arm microprocessors several graphic

1286
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:51,400
processing units to handle the video the

1287
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,440
image processing and other specialized

1288
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,019
pieces of hardware that are only used

1289
01:05:53,440 --> 01:06:01,049
for very specific things so for example

1290
01:05:56,019 --> 01:06:03,369
there's a JPEG encoding and decoding is

1291
01:06:01,049 --> 01:06:06,700
directly integrated into Hardware on

1292
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:08,999
this chip there's a actually some

1293
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:12,579
special logic for when you take

1294
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:15,220
panoramic shots and then you merge those

1295
01:06:12,579 --> 01:06:17,619
all together which I don't know about

1296
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:19,509
you but I don't do that very often but

1297
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:21,369
there's still some special dedicated

1298
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:22,779
Hardware on those chips to do that

1299
01:06:21,369 --> 01:06:25,480
because it takes a lot of power

1300
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:29,289
otherwise so in general if you can take

1301
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:32,289
a some compute computing and turn it

1302
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:35,109
from software and migrate it to hardware

1303
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:37,720
you get a big performance increase and a

1304
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:39,430
major power reduction so they're putting

1305
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,500
more stuff on a chip not to give you

1306
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:44,130
more possible

1307
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:47,880
powerful processor but to be able to do

1308
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:51,330
more stuff at lower power so that's why

1309
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,980
these chips get more so my point is that

1310
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:57,150
they're already sort of we're already in

1311
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:59,730
an era when the driving reason for

1312
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:01,830
Moore's law isn't so much to get raw

1313
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:05,450
performance out of these systems but to

1314
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:06,660
give you more features various sorts

1315
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:13,650
okay

1316
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:17,270
so looking to the future then as I said

1317
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:21,300
it you can look at since 65 it's been a

1318
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:24,120
very long set of incremental

1319
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:27,660
improvements to get from the chips of

1320
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:30,350
Gordon Moore's early career to where we

1321
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:33,660
are today we got more stuff on a chip

1322
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:36,120
vastly more capable much more affordable

1323
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:38,070
huge impact on it but from a technology

1324
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,650
point of view it's been a fairly

1325
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:42,120
incremental road to travel we can see

1326
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:43,410
that that's not going to work in the

1327
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:48,270
future we're not going to be able to

1328
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:53,670
scale transistor logic to the level that

1329
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:57,720
you'd need to keep this going so at

1330
01:07:53,670 --> 01:08:00,960
least two-dimensional semiconductor

1331
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:03,930
chips aren't going to carry the way so

1332
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,730
they sort of issues then and you and

1333
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:09,750
your careers will be dealing with these

1334
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:12,180
is will we be able to build systems of

1335
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:14,360
this complexity in a way that's

1336
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:16,529
commercially viable because if it's not

1337
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:19,170
economically viable it's just not going

1338
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:22,799
to happen and power is going to be a

1339
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:24,509
huge problem as we go along and then you

1340
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:28,140
know what would it mean if you actually

1341
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:31,109
had 10 to the 17th I can't think of what

1342
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:35,100
possible capabilities this would give us

1343
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:38,009
that we'd actually want use but again if

1344
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:40,859
I don't think Gordon Moore would have

1345
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:42,930
thought back in 60 if you look at the 65

1346
01:08:40,859 --> 01:08:44,819
paper I recommend you do he actually did

1347
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:46,859
predict things like personal computers

1348
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:50,520
and cell phones believe it or not it's

1349
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:53,160
really true um so he was definitely

1350
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:54,170
pretty good but for me I can't predict

1351
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,540
what I

1352
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:59,750
have in 50 years what I do with it and

1353
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:01,490
then for more the software people you

1354
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:05,590
know what what mean will there be

1355
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:05,590
programming we certainly won't be

1356
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:11,660
writing lines of code in C in order to

1357
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:13,910
power systems like this so what will

1358
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:19,490
that mean for the future those are all

1359
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:22,030
big questions that you and this point of

1360
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:26,110
your careers get to look forward to so I

1361
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:26,110
wish you the best in doing that
